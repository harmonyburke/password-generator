## Installation

visit this webpage at [https://harmonyburke.github.io/password-generator/]
## Usage

To use the password generator, simply click on the 'generate password' button on the bottom of the screen. Then answer the following prompts regarding password length, the font type(uppercase or lowercase), numbers and special characters. Once all answers are provided, your new password will appear in the box that currently says 'your new password'!


## Credits
I received help with this webpage from a tutor(Josshy Olea).
I also used the activities we used in class in Week 3 as a refernce point as well as finding additional information from [https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_concat_array.asp.]





## Tests

To test the webpage to ensure it is functioning properly, click on the generate password button. In the first prompt, it asks you to enter a numeric value between 8 and 128. If you enter any other value, it should prompt you to enter a correct value. All other prompts are a simple yes or no answer. Once all prompts are answered, the password should appear in the box.
